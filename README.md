# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
...and Thank you for taking the time to meet me!

## About
I'm a Flutter developer since 2019 and former iOS developer (2015-2019). I am a responsible, self-organized and reliable business partner. I always stay in touch, keep up with deadlines and do not keep silent about problems.

### MySciHub
I have studied the code written by another developer, dive into its work, and embed new functionality.

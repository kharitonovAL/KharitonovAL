# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
...and Thank you for taking the time to meet me!

## About me
I am an experienced Flutter developer with a background in developing mobile applications for iOS in Swift (4 years exp.). I started working with Flutter in November 2019.
My qualities include: diligence, a desire to work efficiently, fast learning ability, stress resistance, conflict-free, ability to work in a time-deficient mode, organization, and responsibility.
I can read the documentation fluently in English, and I also speak English (B1, Intermediate).
For self-organization and control of work on all projects, I use boards in Trello, Apple Calendar for time tracking, and GitHub for version control.

## My experience
### Operator18
My best experience with Flutter is a [CRM system for management companies](https://github.com/kharitonovAL/o18).
The system is structured as follows:
1. Two client-server projects: one for the management company and its employees, the other for the owners of staff. Both projects are designed and developed for three platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
2. One server project on Dart to implement a Telegram bot for customers (more information about the bot can be found in my article on Medium).

You can remotely check how the system works on its [demo site](https://v2.operator18.ru). Use login operator@mail.ru and password operator.
The CRM system has allowed the management company to establish some work processes, in particular: to increase the speed of application processing, to improve control over the execution of applications, to speed up and automate the Operator's tasks, and to ensure the possibility of quick communication with residents through push notifications.
In this project, the backend was deployed on a VDS with MongoDB utilized under ParseServer. For push notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging was employed. The project was developed using MobX for the mobile apps and Bloc for the web app.

### MySciHub
My other experience is adding functionality to the existing MySciHub application.
In the course of my work, I had to study the code written by another developer, dive into its work, and embed new functionality. In particular, it was necessary to be able to add new events through the mobile application. At the moment, the work has been handed over to the customer.

### Workee
Introducing the [Workee app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.narushev.workee) - an exceptional experience!
This app, which I developed for a client, is a remarkable and intricate project.
To ensure efficient state management, I opted for the Mobx library. The backend relies on Firebase, encompassing Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Messaging.
Workee allows users to effortlessly create tasks while enabling others to conveniently complete them. Moreover, the app boasts a comprehensive rating and recommendation system. To ensure a safe environment, we have also implemented a robust censor system, effectively preventing any harmful user behavior.
